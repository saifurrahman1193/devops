### The | Pipe Command in Linux
- chaining commands together


```
ls -l | grep "myfile.txt"

In this example:

    ls -l lists files in a long format.
    The output of ls -l is piped/chained to grep/search "myfile".
    grep "myfile" searches for lines containing "myfile" in the input (which is the output of ls -l).
```

```
ps aux | grep 'python' | sort -k 4  # Lists processes, filters for Python processes, and sorts them by memory usage.

find . -name "*.txt" | wc -l # Counts the number of text files in the current directory and its subdirectories.

cat files.txt | wc -w  # Counts the number of words in the files.txt file.
```

## whoami
- print the username of the user currently logged into the system.
## su
- switch to another user account on the system.
```
su user1
```
## cd
```
cd directory_name
```
