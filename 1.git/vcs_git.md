Required Before Commit: Changes must be added to the staging area with git add before they can be committed.


### Commit

- Snapshot of Changes: A commit records all staged changes in the project.
- Unique ID (SHA-1 Hash): Each commit is uniquely identified by a hash, making it easy to track and reference.
- Commit Message: A message describing what changes were made, added with the -m flag (e.g., git commit -m "Description").
- Building Project History: Each commit builds on the previous, creating a timeline of changes.
- must be added first (tracking)
- after commit files goes from staging environment then move changes  to the repositoryvc
- mainly save the files

Key Command:

```
git commit -m "commit message"
```
Amending a Commit: You can modify the last commit with git commit --amend (useful for updating messages or adding files).


### Branch
- Branches allow isolated work on features, fixes, or experiments.
- tree root

### checkout

### head
- Tracks the Current Position: HEAD points to the most recent commit in your current branch.
- has an address

### staging
- after use ```git add file_name or folder_name or (.)```
- Staging Area: A temporary space that holds changes you plan to commit.
- Selective Commits: You can choose specific changes to include in each commit by staging only certain files or portions of files.
- Staging Changes: Use git add to add changes to the staging area.
- Viewing Staged Changes: Use git status to see which changes are staged vs. unstaged.
- Making a Commit: Once staged, you commit the changes with git commit, which moves them from the staging area to the repositoryâ€™s history.
